I have just started this project, there is not much actual data yet. Stay
tuned!

Various fediverse software has adopted the 'Mastodon Api' as the
unofficial-official standard for clients to consume. However, as this api is
ever evolving it's hard to tell exactly that means. This project attempts to
document exactly what is available for each version of each major compatible
software.

The idea is to be able to answer questions like:
- "What apis are widely supported?"
- "Which versions can I call this api on?"
- "What deprecated apis are safe to not support?"
